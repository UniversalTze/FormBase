# FormBase
FormBase is a prototype mobile app built with Expo and React Native that
lets users create flexible data-collection forms on the fly. Each form can
include a mix of field types — text, multiline text, dropdowns, image/camera
and location (i.e. capture the users location) with options for marking fields as
required or numeric. Once a form with fields is created, users can save
records. Users can define custom filter (including numeric comparisons and
string comparisons), and visualize location results on a map. The prototype
demonstrates how lightweight, mobile-first tools can empower users to
design, collect, and explore structured data without needing a custom
backend for every use case but lacks features for editing/updating fields.
